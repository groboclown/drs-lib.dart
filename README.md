Discrete Reactive Simulation
============================

The Discrete Reactive Simulation Dart Library (drs-lib) follows a strict
architecture for the construction of a reactive simulation of a
Fuzzy Cognitive Map executed in discrete time increments.

[You can read the architecture overview here](https://rawgithub.com/groboclown/drs-lib.dart/master/doc/architecture/index.html)


Current Status
--------------

The engine is being constructed.  Still very much pre alpha.

This project follows the
[Dart Package Layout Conventions](http://pub.dartlang.org/doc/package-layout.html)



Road Map
========

Phase 1:
--------

1. Engine architecture document. *In progress*

2. Initial cut of engine and unit tests. *In progress*

3. Sample simulation.

4. Use the sample simulation to establish patterns seen in the simulation
    construction.

Phase 2:
--------

1. Construct a higher level language to more easily construct simulations.

2. Create a sample simulation using the higher level language.
