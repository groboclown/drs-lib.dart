    A barrier algorithm triggers an action only when <em>all</em> of a
    group of values has changed.
</p>
<p>
    In this library, you can construct a barrier function by creating a
    a new hard value that is initially assigned to the current value in the
    group.  A function is built on top of these two that performs a "is equal"
    comparison, outputting a boolean fuzzy value (0 or 1).
    Then, a function value is added that has all the "is equal" comparison
    outputs as inputs, and outputs the product of all the inputs.
    An action is bound to the function value that resets all the
    hard values to the current value.  Additional actions can then be added
    on the product function to perform the barrier action.
</p>
<p>
    One-time barriers (such as "all values must be setup before a behavior can
    work") add an extra layer with an action setting a value.  This,
    unfortunately, adds an extra cycle before the barrier signals a change.
    A better implementation may be constructed.
