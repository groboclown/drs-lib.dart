<h1>Discrete Reactive Simulation Architecture</h1>



<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
    At a high level, the simulation engine tracks the linking between
    <a href="attribute.html">values</a> on <a href="pragma.html">objects</a>,
    and triggers change signals when the values change.
    The changes result in either changing other values directly via
    linked <a href="function.html">lambda calculus functions</a> and
    bound <a href="action.html">actions</a> that change the state of the
    system.
</p>
<p>
    This document defines the very low level engine design for the simulation
    engine.  A language will need to be built on top of it to easily express
    higher level concepts.
</p>


<h2>About</h2>

<p>
    This architecture describes the details behind the construction of a
    simulation environment that allows for <em>discrete</em> iteration of a
    <em>reactive</em> system.
</p>
<p>
    The system is <em>discrete</em> because it executes a single pass of
    processing signals as a batch as a cycle.  This allows for easier debugging
    of the operation of the system, and a higher level of determanism (but does
    not imply a fully determanistic system).
    A <em>continuous</em> system, on the other hand, processes the signals
    as they occur, without an obvious subdivision of time - that is, the system
    can process new signals between discrete time increments.
</p>
<p>
    The system is <em>reactive</em> because the system only allows communication
    between its parts through signals generated by changes to the system state.
    Also, it hides details on
</p>
<p>
    The system is partially <em>functional</em> in two ways.  First, the basic
    construction of the system involves either a function or an action.
    Functions at as a functional language by hiding whether a referenced value
    is a hard value or a function based on other functions or values.  Second,
    the action operates on a <a href="pragma.html#weak">weak copy</a> of the
    system, allowing them to run in parallel, and all changes are committed
    at the end of the processing.
</p>


<h2>General Details</h2>


<h3>Errors</h3>

<p>
    The system only has soft errors for a configured system, meaning that any
    error encountered creates appropriate logging information for the developer,
    but the simulation itself does not stop.
</p>
<p>
    Hard errors which stop the system happen outside the runtime.  These include
    checking consistency of a system (all the types match up).
