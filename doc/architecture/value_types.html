<h1>Discrete Reactive Simulation Architecture</h1>


<h2>Value Types</h2>

<p>
    The architecture supports a finite list of strong types for its values,
    and sets of these values.  Because of this definition, the
    types do not allow for sets-of-sets.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>String</strong> - an ordered collection of character data.</li>
    <li><strong>Numeric</strong> - a determanistic real number.</li>
    <li><strong>Fuzzy</strong> - a number in the range [0, 1] with specific
        multi-valence set operations.  Systems should use these to represent
        values restricted to a range, or booleans.</li>
    <li><strong>Pragma Link</strong> - a reference to a Link ID for a
        <a href="pragma.html">Pragma</a>.  The reference does not itself
        reference a Pragma, nor does it reflect the linked-to Pragma on the
        currently bound Pragma, but instead must be bound to an owning Pragma
        to find the Pragma by its Link ID.</li>
    <li><strong>Attribute ID</strong> - a reference to a global attribute
        identifier, without any binding to a specific Pragma or its links.</li>
    <li><strong>Attribute Link</strong> - a combination of a Pragma Link and
        an Attribute ID.</li>
    <li><strong>Pragma Handle</strong> - a <a href="#link">reference</a> to a
        specific <a href="pragma.html">Pragma</a>;
        the result of a Pragma Link bound to an owning
        <a href="pragma.html">Pragma</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Attribute Handle</strong> - a reference to an
        <a href="attribute.html">Attribute Value</a> on a specific
        <a href="pragma.html">Pragma</a>; the result of an Attribute Link or
        Attribute ID bound to an owning Pragma.</li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="set">Sets</a></h3>
<p>
    As mentioned above, the engine supports sets of the basic value types, but
    not sets-of-sets.  Note that these are "sets", meaning that they cannot
    contain multiple instances of the same referent value.  This means that
    a set cannot contain to values from the same attribute, but it can hold,
    say, two different attribute values that are both set to 2.
</p>
<p>
    Also, sets have the potential to be lazy-loaded in order to facilitate
    highly parallel operations.  Because of this, the access to the values
    in a set are very restricted.
</p>


<h3><a name="transformation"></a></h3>
<p>
    The system does not allow for implicit transformation from one type to
    another; such transformations must occur through a
    <a href="function.html">Function</a>.
</p>
<p>
    This also means that there MUST NOT be a construction of a reference to
    an ID by concatenating strings or numbers.  These should be handled
    carefully, and constructs containing lists of Pragma should actually use
    a list of Links, rather than building those Links.
</p>



<h3><a name="null">Null Values</a></h3>

<p>
    All value types allow for a null value, which indicates an absence of a
    value.  All base operations on value types require null safety.
</p>
<p>
    Each type has a specific meaning for null values, as interpreted by the
    low-level operations, but additional operations allow for inspecting
    whether the value is null or not.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Set</strong> - an empty set</li>
    <li><strong>String</strong> - an empty string</li>
    <li><strong>Numeric</strong> - 0</li>
    <li><strong>Fuzzy</strong> - 0 (which allows Boolean representations reflect
        allow unassigned values as false)</li>
    <li><strong>Pragma Link</strong> - a null <a href="pragma.html">Pragma</a>,
        which means a <a href="pragma.html">Pragma</a>
        with only Null values for Attributes and Links</li>
    <li><strong>Unassigned Link</strong> - also represents
        a null <a href="pragma.html">Pragma</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Attribute Link</strong> - has the same semantics as a
        null Pragma Link, but references the
        <a href="attribute.html">Attribute</a> of that null
        <a href="pragma.html">Pragma</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Set</strong> - an empty set</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Note that a Set will never contain null values.  It can contain a link to
    an unassigned Pragma, but not null links.
</p>


<h3><a name="link">Links</a> and <a name="handle">Handles</a></h3>

<p>
    <a href="pragma.html">Pragma</a> contain a list of IDs that
    reference globally unique Pragma IDs, distinct from the global ID of the
    Pragma, called Links.  This allows for a common ID to reference a linked
    Pragma (such as "location").
</p>
<p>
    A Link Value to a <a href="pragma.html">Pragma</a> is simply the
    generic Link ID.  Binding a Link Value to a Pragma results in a
    <em>Handle</em> to the Pragma in the Links with that generic ID.
</p>
<p>
    Likewise, an Attribute Link is a generic Link ID into that list of
    references, along with an Attribute ID, and binding an Attribute Link to
    a Pragma results in a <em>Handle</em> to the
    <a href="attribute.html">Attribute</a> with that ID on the
    <a href="pragma.html">Pragma</a> in the Links with that generic ID.
</p>
<p>
    An Attribute ID can also be bound to a <a href="pragma.html">Pragma</a>
    to create an Attribute Handle.
</p>
<p>
    The system makes a strong distinction between a
    <a href="pragma.html">Pragma</a> and its Handle in order to enforce the
    limited scope a <a href="function.html">Function</a> has on its input.
    <a href="function.html">Function</a> may output a Pragma Handle or
    Attribute Handle from the binding, which allows the signals generated by
    changes on the corresponding Attribute or Pragma to trigger Actions.
</p>


<h3><a name="signal">Change Signals</a></h3>

<p>
    The simulation engine concerns itself primarily with the management of
    relationships between <a href="function.html">Functions</a> and Values,
    and the creation of signals based on changes to those
    <a href="function.html">Functions</a> and Values.
</p>
<p>
    The engine triggers the execution of an <a href="action.html">Action</a>
    when the bound-to <a href="function.html">Function</a> or Value changes.
    The meaning of "change" depends upon the value type.
</p>
<p>
    For the simpler types - <strong>String</strong>, <strong>Numeric</strong>,
    and <strong>Fuzzy</strong> - the engine considers the value changed when
    the previous value differs from the
    just-<a href="pragma.html#commit">committed</a> value.
</p>
<p>
    The Link types are just as simple in their meaning of change.  Pragma Link
    values, Attribute ID values, and Attribute Link values signal changes when
    the value of the ID to which they reference changes; for the Attribute
    Link, this means either the Pragma ID or the Attribute ID.
</p>
<p>
    A Pragma Handle signals a change when the handle changes to a different
    <a href="pragma.html">Pragma</a>.  So, if the Pragma referenced by the
    corresponding Link changes, then the Pragma Handle changes, resulting in
    the change signal.  A removal of a reference to a Pragma in the links
    results in a null <a href="pragma.html">Pragma</a> referenced by the
    Handle.  It also can potentially change when the Link ID changes value.
</p>
<p>
    Likewise, an Attribute Handle signals a change just like a Pragma Handle,
    when the corresponding linked-to Pragma changes, or when the Attribute ID
    in the corresponding Attribute Link changes to reference a different
    Attribute ID.
